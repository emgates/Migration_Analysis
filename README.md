# Migration_Analysis
Identification of migrating cells and analysis using PIV

This code is designed to analyze 1) a migrating leading edge or 2) patterned cell populations.

Ideally, this code will provide information relating to:
-Cell speed
-Cell order
-Cell velocity correlation
-Cell vorticity
-Cell persistence
